# Matt Alter's Serve Robotics Live Map


## The project has two parts

### Server
- First, `cd` to `/server` and run `npm install` and then `npm start`

### Front-end
- Once the server is running, from the root `/`, run `npm install` to install all project packages. Then, run `npm start` to start the front-end of the project.


### Front-end
- Built with React, it uses open streetmaps to generate the map.  
- Uses React Leaflet to generate a popover visible on hover of each robot to show its number and geo positioning
Run using `npm start`
